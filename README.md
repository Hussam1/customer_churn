# Title of your project


# Summary

**Motivation:** As part of my data science bootcamps projects, we intent to perform "customer churn modeling" for company within the telecom industry
<br />
<br />**Goal:** The goal is to test and train multiple machine learning models in order to select the one with most valid business case
<br />
<br />**Business Case:** The company will be using this model to predict customers at risk of churning. hypothetical case was:
<br />1- The contract's life time value is 1000$
<br />2- Customers at risk of churning will be called and offered 10% discount if they maintain/continue their contract
<br />3- based on the model results, what is the net effect on the company's income statement
<br />
<br />**Next Steps:** 
<br />- Test if customer's location has any impact on customer's behaviour
<br />- Test if manipulating correlated features will have impact on customer's behaviour and subsequently churning rate
<br />- Expand more on hyperparameter tuning
<br />**Structure of the document:** if the document is getting big, outline the structure and explain the different parts
